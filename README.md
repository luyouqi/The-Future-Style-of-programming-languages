The Future-like style of programming language

It’s not code for programers:
def  function1:
a = b
here is real feeling for programers:
def function1(sdflke,ektjfla;sjfo8xcvl,
                         erlwaufosd(sdfe),lgjsdf,rtkasdl):
a =bsadfke.oaf.dsfelk.sdatr4+sdfle4k
      -felasdkf.sfe*feasdlfke /asfde.sfle.lenalskf3234^sl()
      *sfelkjadlskfjeo


Fools like to imagine crazily,  I’m very stupid,  so…..

To represent a specific data type with a specific  color , specific character or specific font.  For example, common integer variables are directly represented by a specific  font color; Infrequent integer variables are represented by a specific prefix，for example, “Int_var_name” means common integer type with default color ; ””is a 64-bit integer variable name, and “” means another 64-bit integer data type（Signed integer or unsigned integer）,  or Int_var_name
The definition of a function is represented by a specific  background-color
The definition of  ends with a line of thick line-divider.
Some built-in classes / functions use graphics to represent names
class-names / function-name / variable-name / name-space / module-name /…,  has a unique form
By analyzing the code in the screen, the AI changes the colors, prefixes, and fonts of the lower-case strings entered by humans.
The upper part of the illustration below is about the future evolution of the keywords 'while(white)', 'for(yellow)', 'if(red)', 'elseif(blue)', 'else(green)'.   tip: whi*e-RBG
The second half of the illustration is about  the future evolution form of the definition of 'class', 'function' .

It’s close to the ultimate form of programming language
